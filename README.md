# GifTastic
For this program, using the Giphy API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs.

### Instructions

1. Start with an array of strings, each one related to a topic.  Save to a variable called: topics.

2. App should take the topics in this array and create buttons in html.
*Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

3. When the user clikcs on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate.  If the user clikcs the gif again, it should stop playing. (review coding from class activity)

5. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
*The data is provided by the GIPHY API.
*Only once you get images displaying with button presses shoudl you move on to the next step.

6. Add a form to your page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your topics array.  Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
